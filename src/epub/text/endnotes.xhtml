			<p id="note1"><a href="#note-link1">1</a> In Schweighaeuser's edition the title is ''<span class="greek">Επικτήτου ἐγχειρίδιον</span>. Epicteti Manuale ex recensione et interpretatione Joannis Uptoni. Notabiliorem Lectionis varietatem adjecit Joh. Schweighaeuser.' There are also notes by Upton, and some by Schweighaeuser.</p>
			<p id="note2"><a href="#note-link2">2</a> This passage will be obscure in the original, unless it is examined well. I have followed the explanation of Simplicius, iv. (i. 4.)</p>
			<p id="note3"><a href="#note-link3">3</a> Appearances are named 'harsh' or 'rough' when they are 'con- trary to reason and overexciting and in fact make life rough (uneven) by the want of symmetry and by inequality in the movements simplicius, v. (i. 5.)</p>
			<p id="note4"><a href="#note-link4">4</a> See the notes in Schweig.'s edition.</p>
			<p id="note5"><a href="#note-link5">5</a> Upton proposes to read <span class="greek">ἐφ᾽ ἱπποῦ ἀγαφῷ</span> instead of <span class="greek">ἐπὶ ἵππῳ ἀγαφῷ</span>. The meaning then will be 'elated at something good which is in the horse.' I think that he is right.</p>
			<p id="note6"><a href="#note-link6">6</a> The text has <span class="greek">τὰ γενόμενα</span>: but it should be <span class="greek">τὰ γινόμενα</span>. See Upton's note.</p>
			<p id="note7"><a href="#note-link7">7</a> He means, Do not chastise your slave while you are in a passion, lest, while you are trying to correct him, and it is very doubtful whether you will succeed, you fall into a vice which is a man's great and only calamity. Schweig.</p>
			<p id="note8"><a href="#note-link8">8</a> The passage seems to mean, that your slave has not the power of disturbing you, because you have the power of not being disturbed. See Upton's note on the text.</p>
			<p id="note9"><a href="#note-link9">9</a> <span class="greek">Τέλειν</span> is used here, as it often is among the Stoics, to 'wish absolutely,' 'to will.' When Epictetus says 'you would have badness not to be badness,' he means that 'badness' is in the will of him who has the badness, and as you wish to subject it to your will, you are a fool. It is your business, as far as you can, to improve the slave: you may wish this. It is his business to obey your instruction: this is what he ought to wish to do; but for him to will to do this, that lies in himself, not in you. Schweig.</p>
			<p id="note10"><a href="#note-link10">10</a> This is obscure. 'It is true that the man is wretched, not because of the things external which have happened to him, but through the fact that he allows himself to be affected so much by external things which are placed out of his power.' Schweig.</p>
			<p id="note11"><a href="#note-link11">11</a> It has been objected to Epictetus that he expresses no sympathy with those who suffer sorrow. But here he tells you to show sympathy, a thing which comforts most people. But it would be contrary to hi. teaching, if he told you to suffer mentally with another.</p>

			<p id="note18"><a href="#note-link18">18</a> See Schweig.'s note.</p>
			<p id="note19"><a href="#note-link19">19</a> This passage is explained in the commentary of Simplicius, (xxxiv., in Schweig.'s ed. xxvii. p. 264), and Schweighaeuser agrees with the explanation, which is this: Nothing in the world (universe) can exist or be done (happen) which in its proper sense, in itself and in its nature is bad; for every thing is and is done by the wisdom and will of God and for the purpose which he intended: but to miss a mark is to fail in an intention; and as a man does not set up a mark, or does not form a purpose for the purpose of missing the mark or the purpose, so it is absurd (inconsistent) to say that God has a purpose or design, and that he purposed or designed anything which in itself and in its nature is bad. The commentary of Simplicius is worth reading. But how many will read it? Perhaps one in a million.</p>
			<p id="note20"><a href="#note-link20">20</a> ' Compare iii. 15, from which all this passage has been transferred to the Encheiridion by the copyists.' Upton. On which Schweighaeuser remarks, 'Why should we not say by Arrian, who composed the Encheiridion from the Discourses of Epictetus?' See the notes of Upton and Schweig. on some differences in the readings of the passage in iii. 15, and in this passage.</p>
			<p id="note21"><a href="#note-link21">21</a> See ii. 22, 13, iv. 5, 9.</p>
			<p id="note22"><a href="#note-link22">22</a> 'It is plain enough that the philosopher does not say this, that the reckoning of our private advantage ought to be the sole origin and foundation of piety towards God.' Schweig., and he proceeds to explain the sentence, which at first appears rather obscure Perhaps Arrian intends to say that the feeling of piety coincides with the opinion of the useful, the profitable; and that the man who takes care to desire as he ought to do and to avoid as he ought to do, thus also cares after piety, and so he will secure his interest (the profitable) and he will not be discontented. In i. 27, 14 (p. 81) it is said <span class="greek">ἐὰν μὴ ἐν τῷ αὐτῷ ᾖ τὸ εὐσεβὲς καὶ συμφέρον, οὐ δύναται σωφῆναι τὸ εὐσεβὲς ἔν τινι</span>. This is what is said here (s. 31).<p/></p>
			<p id="note23"><a href="#note-link23">23</a> The story is told by Aelian (iii. c. 44), and by Simplicius in his commentary on the Encheiridion (p. 411, ed. Schweig.). Upton.</p>
			<p id="note24"><a href="#note-link24">24</a> 'Convivia cum hominibus extraneis et rudibus, discipline non imbutis' is the Latin version.</p>
			<p id="note25"><a href="#note-link25">25</a> The text is <span class="greek">ὡς νόμιμον</span>: and the Latin explanation is 'qua fas eat uti; qua uti absque flagitio licet.'</p>
			<p id="note26"><a href="#note-link26">26</a> To admire (<span class="greek">φαυμάζειν</span>) is contrary to the precept of Epictetus; i. 29, ii. 6, iii. 20. Upton.</p>
			<p id="note27"><a href="#note-link27">27</a> Such recitations were common at Rome, when authors read their works and invited persons to attend. These recitations are often mentioned in the letters of the younger Pliny. See Epictetus, iii. 23.</p>
			<p id="note28"><a href="#note-link28">28</a> Compare i. 25, 11, etc.</p>
			<p id="note29"><a href="#note-link29">29</a> See the note of Schweig. on xxxvi.</p>
			<p id="note30"><a href="#note-link30">30</a> <blockquote><p>“<span class="la">Cui non conveniet sua res, ut calceus olim,<br/>
			Si pede major erit, subvertet; si minor, uret.<br/>
			<p/></span>”</p><div align="right"><b><a href="text?doc=Hor. Ep. 1.10.42&amp;lang=original" target="_new"><span class="en">Horat.

			<p id="note31"><a href="#note-link31">31</a> The word is <span class="greek">κεντητόν</span> <span class="la">'acu pictum,'</span> ornamented by needlework.</p>
			<p id="note32"><a href="#note-link32">32</a> Fourteen was considered the age of puberty in Roman males, but in females the age of twelve (Justin. Inst. I. tit. 22). Compare Gaius, i. 196.</p>
			<p id="note33"><a href="#note-link33">33</a> See Mrs. C.'s note, in which she says' Epictetus seems to be in part mistaken here,' etc.; and I think that he is.</p>
			<p id="note34"><a href="#note-link34">34</a> <span class="greek">τὸ ἀληφὲς συμπεπλεγμένον</span> is rendered in the Latin by 'verum con- junctum.' Mrs. Carter renders it by 'a true proposition,' which I suppose to be the meaning.</p>
			<p id="note35"><a href="#note-link35">35</a> Mrs. Carter translates this, “Unless you perfectly understand the principle [from which anyone acts].”</p>
			<p id="note36"><a href="#note-link36">36</a> See iii. 23, 22; iv. 8, 2.</p>
			<p id="note37"><a href="#note-link37">37</a> See iii. 12.</p>
			<p id="note38"><a href="#note-link38">38</a> This may mean,' what is proposed to you by philosophers,' and especially in this little book. Sechweighaeuser thinks that it may mean 'what you have proposed to yourself:' but he is inclined to understand it simply, 'what is proposed above, or taught above.'</p>
			<p id="note39"><a href="#note-link39">39</a> <span class="greek">τὸν διαιροῦντα λόγον</span>. 'Eam partitioned rationis intelligo, qua initio dixit, Quaedam in potestate nostra esse, quaedam non esse.' Wolf</p>
			<p id="note40"><a href="#note-link40">40</a> The first four verses are by the Stoic Cleanthes, the pupil of Zeno, and the teacher of Chrysippus. He was a native of Assus in Mysia; and Simplicius, who wrote his commentary on the Encheiridion in the sixth century, A. D., saw even at this late period in Assus a beautiful statue of Cleanthes erected by a decree of the Roman senate in honour of this excellent man. (Simplicius, ed. Schweig. p. 522.)</p>
			<p id="note41"><a href="#note-link41">41</a> The two second verses are from a play of Euripides, a writer who has supplied more verses for quotation than any antient tragedian.</p>
			<p id="note42"><a href="#note-link42">42</a> The third quotation is from the Criton of Plato. Socrates is the speaker. The last part is from the Apology of Plato, and Socrates is also the speaker. The words 'and the third also,' Schweighaeuser says, have been introduced from the commentary of Simplicius. Simplicius concludes his commentary thus: Epictetus connects the end with the beginning, which reminds us of what was said in the beginning, that the man who places the good and the evil among the things which are in our power, and not in externals, will neither be compelled by any man nor ever injured.<p/></p>
