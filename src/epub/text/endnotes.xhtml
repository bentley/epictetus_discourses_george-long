					<p>Upton proposes to read <i xml:lang="grc">ἐφ᾽ ἱπποῦ ἀγαφῷ</i> instead of <i xml:lang="grc">ἐπὶ ἵππῳ ἀγαφῷ</i>. The meaning then will be “elated at something good which is in the horse.” I think that he is right. <a href="the-encheiridion.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>He means, Do not chastise your slave while you are in a passion, lest, while you are trying to correct him, and it is very doubtful whether you will succeed, you fall into a vice which is a man’s great and only calamity. <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:surname">Schweig.</abbr> <a href="the-encheiridion.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><i xml:lang="grc">Τέλειν</i> is used here, as it often is among the Stoics, to “wish absolutely,” “to will.” When Epictetus says “you would have badness not to be badness,” he means that “badness’ is in the will of him who has the badness, and as you wish to subject it to your will, you are a fool. It is your business, as far as you can, to improve the slave: you may wish this. It is his business to obey your instruction: this is what he ought to wish to do; but for him to will to do this, that lies in himself, not in you. <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:surname">Schweig.</abbr> <a href="the-encheiridion.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This is obscure. “It is true that the man is wretched, not because of the things external which have happened to him, but through the fact that he allows himself to be affected so much by external things which are placed out of his power.” <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:surname">Schweig.</abbr> <a href="the-encheiridion.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>It has been objected to Epictetus that he expresses no sympathy with those who suffer sorrow. But here he tells you to show sympathy, a thing which comforts most people.

					<p>This passage is explained in the commentary of Simplicius, (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">xxxiv</span>, in <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">Schweig.</abbr>’s <abbr>ed.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xxvii</span> <abbr>p.</abbr> 264), and Schweighaeuser agrees with the explanation, which is this: Nothing in the world (universe) can exist or be done (happen) which in its proper sense, in itself and in its nature is bad; for everything is and is done by the wisdom and will of God and for the purpose which he intended: but to miss a mark is to fail in an intention; and as a man does not set up a mark, or does not form a purpose for the purpose of missing the mark or the purpose, so it is absurd (inconsistent) to say that God has a purpose or design, and that he purposed or designed anything which in itself and in its nature is bad. The commentary of Simplicius is worth reading. But how many will read it? Perhaps one in a million. <a href="the-encheiridion.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“It is plain enough that the philosopher does not say this, that the reckoning of our private advantage ought to be the sole origin and foundation of piety towards God.” <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">Schweig.</abbr>, and he proceeds to explain the sentence, which at first appears rather obscure Perhaps Arrian intends to say that the feeling of piety coincides with the opinion of the useful, the profitable; and that the man who takes care to desire as he ought to do and to avoid as he ought to do, thus also cares after piety, and so he will secure his interest (the profitable) and he will not be discontented.

The words “and the third also,” Schweighaeuser says, have been introduced from the commentary of Simplicius. Simplicius concludes his commentary thus: Epictetus connects the end with the beginning, which reminds us of what was said in the beginning, that the man who places the good and the evil among the things which are in our power, and not in externals, will neither be compelled by any man nor ever injured. <a href="the-encheiridion.xhtml#noteref-42" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
